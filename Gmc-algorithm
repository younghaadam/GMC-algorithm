// Read the input sentence.

// Initialize three counters: length to 0, wordCount to 0, and vowelCount to 0.

// Iterate over each character in the sentence from the first character to the last character (excluding the point).

// For each character:

// Increment the length counter by 1.
// If the character is a letter (a-z or A-Z), check if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, both lowercase and uppercase). If it is, increment the vowelCount counter by 1.
// If the character is a space, increment the wordCount counter by 1.
// Output the values of length, wordCount, and vowelCount.
